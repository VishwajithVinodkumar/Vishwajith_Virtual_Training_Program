Scenario:
 Automating file backup and reporting to the system. Create a shell script called backup_manager.sh that performs the following tasks incorporating the concepts suggested.
 
Requirements:

1. Command-line Arguments and Quoting:

The script must accept three arguments:

Source directory: A directory containing files to back up.
Backup directory: The destination where files will be backed up.
File extension: A specific file extension to filter (e.g., .txt).

./backup_manager.sh "/home/user/source" "/backup" ".txt"

2. Globbing:
 The script should use globbing to find all files in the source directory matching the provided file extension.
 
3. Export Statements:
 Use export to set an environment variable BACKUP_COUNT, which tracks the total number of files backed up during the script execution.
 
4. Array Operations:
 Store the list of files to be backed up in an array.
 Print the names of these files along with their sizes before performing the backup.
 
5. Conditional Execution:
If the backup directory does not exist, create it. If creation fails, exit with an error.
If the source directory is empty or contains no files matching the extension, exit with a message.
If a file already exists in the backup directory with the same name, only overwrite it if it is older than the source file (compare timestamps).

6. Output Report:

After the backup, generate a summary report displaying:

Total files processed.
Total size of files backed up.
The path to the backup directory.
The report should be saved in the backup directory as backup_report.log
